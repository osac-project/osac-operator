              restartRequestedAt:
                description: |-
                  RestartRequestedAt is a timestamp signal to request a VM restart.

                  Set this field to the current time (usually NOW) to request a restart.
                  The controller will execute the restart if this timestamp is greater than
                  status.lastRestartedAt.

                  This is a declarative signal mechanism - the timestamp is a monotonically
                  increasing value to detect new restart requests, not a scheduled time.
                  Typically set to the current time for immediate restarts.

                  External schedulers can set this field on a schedule to implement
                  scheduled maintenance windows if needed.
